            Hi there! My name is Cassidy and I'm a software engineer at <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>. I'm
            also the director of outreach at <a href="https://ckeys.org/">cKeys</a>, and enjoy building mechanical
            keyboards and playing music in my free time.
        </div>
        <div class="bio long">
            Well hello there! My name is Cassidy and I'm a software engineer at
            <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a> and the director of outreach at
            <a href="https://ckeys.org/">cKeys</a>. Before now, I worked at Amazon, L4 Digital, Clarifai, and Venmo, and
            graduated from Iowa State in 2014. <br />
            I run <a href="https://tinyletter.com/cassidoo">a weekly newsletter</a> and love teaching and helping people
            become better coders! In my spare time, I love building mechanical keyboards and LEGO sets, and occasionally
            stream with my sister Cami on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/leakybucketdesign">Twitch</a>. We also like to
            make cool things with our laser cutter and 3D printer, and have
            <a href="http://leakybucket.design">a little Etsy shop</a> if you want to check it out! I also started a
            <a href="https://www.patreon.com/cassidoo">Patreon</a> if you'd like to chat with me regularly, get resume
            reviews, schedule mock interviews with me, or get a few coupons and gifts from me on occasion. No pressure to
            join in, and I appreciate your support a ton no matter what! <br />
            In terms of where I am on the internet (and off), you might have seen me in
            <a href="https://www.glamour.com/gallery/top-new-women-leaders-in-technology">Glamour Magazine</a> or the
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B07L6S92HG/">Big Dream documentary</a> a few years back, or
            more recently you might have seen my
            <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/massdrop-x-hasbro-scrabble-keyboard">Scrabble keyboard</a> project
            in a couple dozen different publications! I've spoken at over a hundred events around the world, and have made
            online classes on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/cassidywilliams/">Udemy</a>,
            <a href="https://www.skillshare.com/r/profile/Cassidy-Williams/3062729">Skillshare</a>, and moooore. I'll
            (likely) happily speak at your event or podcast, or do influencer work for your org. Feel free to
            <a href="mailto:cassidy@cassidoo.co">email me</a> with details! <br />
            Alright, since you've read this far, have a joke: Why are mountains so funny? Because they're hill areas.

            Cassidy is a Senior Software Engineer making the web work at CodePen. She's worked for Amazon, L4 Digital,
            Clarifai, and Venmo, and graduated with a computer science degree from Iowa State University in 2014. She's
            had the honor of working with various organizations, including cKeys and Hacker Fund as their Director of
            Outreach. She's active in the developer community and one of Glamour Magazine's 35 Women Under 35 Changing the
            Tech Industry and LinkedIn's Top Professionals 35 &amp; Under. As an avid speaker, Cassidy has participated in
            meetups and events including the Grace Hopper Celebration for Women in Computing, SXSW, the National Center
            for Women &amp; IT Summit, TEDxDesMoines, the United Nations, and the U.S.A. Science and Engineering Festival.
            She wants to inspire generations of STEM students to be the best they can be, and her favorite quote is from
            Helen Keller: "One can never consent to creep when one feels an impulse to soar." She loves mechanical
            keyboards and karaoke.
