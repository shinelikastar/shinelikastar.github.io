        I worked on Coloring Books, a project to see the colors of literature with three other students at Hack@Brown.
        Over the course of eight hours, we designed and developed the site, during which I was primarily responsible for
        calculating the colors in different works of literature. I developed a Python script to find the frequency of
        colors in
        each story. The frequency values are then mapped onto the site. For instance, Little Red Riding Hood is
        displayed in all red, because red is only the color mentioned in the story.
    </p>

    <p>
        The colors were beautiful to visualize, but we were also interested to explore if color could be embedded in the
        words themselves. For instance, what color is sadness?
        Using Google's <a href="https://github.com/tmikolov/word2vec">word2vec</a> model, on each story to find
        the words that are closely associated with each color.

        A rainbow of my favorite word-colors:

    </p>

    <p>
        Orange in Picture of Dorian Grey:
        orange wry beetle spasm town, chests welled hell brown, defeats lamplit
    </p>

    <p>
        Yellow in Yellow Wallpaper:

    </p>

    </p>

    </p>

    <p>
        Grey in Les Miserable:

    </p>

    <p>
        Black in Jane Eyre:
        black little one must would like you, never me, could still
    </p>

    <p>
        This project was an intersection of our group’s interest in design, literature, and the cool things word2vec can
        do. It was my first hackathon and I loved the energy. The process of creating, coding, and last-minute problem
        solving was exhilarating.
