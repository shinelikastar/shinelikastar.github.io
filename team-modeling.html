    <p>
        Over the summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to pursue research at the University of Michigan Crowds +
        Machines Lab. As an undergraduate researcher, I worked on a project to design optimal configurations of teams.
    </p>

    <p>
        Historically, large organizations are structured in a hierarchical manner. Our goal is to see if we can
        determine a more effective structure for collaboration. I chose this project because I have always been
        interested in the formation of connections. I wanted to know if there was a way to model the communication
        concretely.
    </p>

    <p>
        Over the course of ten weeks, I worked with Dr. Walter Lasecki in deriving mathematical models for
        communication, task trade-offs, skill improvement, and connection formation. Based on these models, I used <a
            href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>
        and JavaScript to create a simulator that visualizes performance of teams of workers over time.
    </p>

    <p>
        After my internship, I will continue exploring the formation of structures. I stayed on as a
        collaborator, working on the project remotely at school. In the future, I hope to test our method
        on compelling use cases of real-life teams and organizations.
