This was a whimsical project I worked on with my friends for the final in Graphics (CS1230), modeling a museum for eggs. We learned that shadow mapping is hard, eggs do not obey mathematical modeling, and that GLSL is maddening to debug, but always just so cool.",

I designed the popup to control the settings for the extenstion, logic for the pomodoro timers, and created real-time data visualizations of user browsing history. This was my first large-scale software project. The best part was watching my friends use whenever they needed to be productive. ",
